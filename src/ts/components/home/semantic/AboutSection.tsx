                Hello, my name is <strong className="hover-text">Francisco</strong>. <br />
                I am a python developer with a background in QA, Automation, and Software Development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've had the opportunity to work for a <strong><a href="https://valuestreamengineering.com/" target="_blank" className="hover-text">start-up</a></strong>, where I've had the privilege to work with multiple clients and tech stacks
                â€” gaining invaluable knowledge and skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I've been expanding my skill set by developing projects involving various
                programming languages and frameworks.
                At this point in my career, I am looking forward to pursuing a <strong className="hover-text">software engineering</strong> role.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm away from the keyboard, I'm usually reading, running, hanging out
                with friends and family, or attending to my <span className="plant-icon">plants</span>.
